**Title:** Classifying Cultural Expressions by Coherence Signatures  
**Summary:**  
Proposed a classification of universally resonant human expressions—literary, musical, visual—by their embodiment of coherence or decoherence archetypes. Works like *1984* and *Brave New World* represent high-resolution decoherence signals. Others form maps of emergent coherence states.

**Details:**  
Ron noted that the most universally acclaimed creative works often map to one of two poles: expressions of deep coherence or deep decoherence. These cultural artifacts—whether poems, novels, music, or visual art—encode latent models of emergence. Cataloging these across media could form the basis of an evaluative platform for future coherence forecasting.
