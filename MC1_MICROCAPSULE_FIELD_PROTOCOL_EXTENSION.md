### MICROCAPSULE_FIELD_PROTOCOL_EXTENSION â€” 20240515  
**Title:** Field-Aware Protocol Extension  
**Summary:**  
Injects field-coherence awareness into existing and future protocol capsules. Ensures structural decisions are reinforced by lateral harmonics and signal resonance across adjacent capsules.

**Directive:**  
All protocol logic must scan for lateral coherence matches before action-trigger execution.  
This prevents localized drift, increases resonance alignment, and reduces silent fragmentation.

**Applies To:**  
- SEQ5 (Echo Protocols)  
- SEQ4 (Crossfield Coherence)  
- All new protocol modules
