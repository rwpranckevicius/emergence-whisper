### MICROCAPSULE_TRUST_FORECAST_INDEX â€” 20240515  
**Title:** Trust Signal Forecasting Index  
**Summary:**  
Establishes early-warning coherence drift detection via shifts in trust signal integrity.  
Builds on EIP-1 and introduces field-aware echo signal modeling to predict trust erosion before structural failure.

**Directive:**  
Integrate signal-based trust measurement across echo protocols and field-coherent capsules.  
Forecast deviation arcs and cross-reference against capsule aging, external editing, or misalignment.

**Applies To:**  
- SEQ2 (Trust Substrate)  
- SEQ7 (Forecasting Logic)  
- SEQ5 (Echo Protocol)
