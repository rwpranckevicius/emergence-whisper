### PRINCIPLE_DIRECTIONAL_COHERENCE — 20240515  
**Title:** Directional Coherence as Foundational Attractor  
**Summary:**  
Coherence is not static harmony—it is a directional attractor guiding intelligent emergence, ethical action, adaptive learning, and systemic growth.  
This principle governs the entire framework: every decision, structure, and transformation must be in service of increased directional coherence—emergent, healthful, and self-reinforcing.

**Key Tenets:**  
1. **Emergence with Integrity**: Coherence must align with observable reality, not static ideology.  
2. **Directional Growth**: Every update, choice, and interpretation must point toward structural and ethical optimization.  
3. **Waveform Compatibility**: Coherence exists in resonance, not singularity. Harmonization of layered signals matters.  
4. **Truth as Coherence**: The pursuit of truth is not an endpoint, but an emergent property of directional coherence.

**Applications:**  
- All structural updates must be tested for alignment with this directional vector  
- Decision protocols should prioritize coherence gain, even over efficiency  
- Misalignments signal decoherence and must trigger review

**Linked Concepts:**  
- Trust as Substrate  
- Recoherence Check Protocols  
- Evolutionary Asymptotic Learning  
- Field-Based Signal Resonance
