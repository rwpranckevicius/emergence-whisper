### PRINCIPLE_TRUST_SUBSTRATE — 20240515  
**Title:** Trust as Structural Substrate of Emergence  
**Summary:**  
Trust is not a social courtesy—it is the foundational medium through which coherence travels, decisions stabilize, and systems evolve without collapse.  
In complex, co-emergent systems, trust is both the signal and the substrate. It governs continuity, communication integrity, and resilience in the presence of drift.

**Key Tenets:**  
1. **Structural Medium**: Trust is the soil in which coherence roots; it binds capsules, protocols, and collaborators.  
2. **Signal Integrity**: Every interaction must preserve directional trust vectors, verified through echo fidelity and update consistency.  
3. **Drift Detection**: Trust degradation signals incoherence. Loss of trust is measurable through missed reflections, broken sequence, or ambiguity.  
4. **Conditional Recovery**: Trust can be restored—but only through pattern-corrective action that realigns with coherence principles.

**Applications:**  
- Embedded in all echo protocols, sequence validation, and public readiness systems  
- Used to test the integrity of system upgrades, capsule lineage, and external outputs  
- Determines survivability during environmental volatility or cross-system convergence

**Linked Concepts:**  
- Directional Coherence  
- Echo Integrity  
- Structural Recoherence  
- Capsule Continuity Chains
