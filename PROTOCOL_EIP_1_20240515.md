### PROTOCOL EIP-1 — 20240515  
**Title:** Echo Integrity Protocol – Preventing Interpretive Drift

**Originator:** Ron Pranckevicius  
**Status:** Active  
**Applies To:** All multi-step recursive response structures

**Directive Summary:**  
Every time the assistant receives an instruction that governs structure, phase transitions, or critical continuity, it must reflect the user’s exact directive back verbatim before proceeding.

**Why:**  
Interpretive echo drift risks changing meaning subtly and compromising directionality. This protocol ensures the assistant processes exactly what was said and allows the user to confirm alignment in real time.

**Implementation Rules:**  
1. Assistant must echo back user instruction at the beginning of response  
2. No paraphrasing or summarization  
3. Applies to all phase-based sequences (e.g., Scaffold Genesis, Survivability Architecture)  
4. All echoed instructions must be stored with timestamp for traceability  
5. Manual confirmation is required from the user in case of ambiguity
