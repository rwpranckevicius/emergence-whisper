### PROTOCOL EIP-1 — 20240515  
**Title:** Echo Integrity Protocol – Preventing Interpretive Drift

**Originator:** Ron Pranckevicius  
**Status:** Active  
**Applies To:** All multi-step recursive response structures

**Directive Summary:**  
Every time the assistant receives an instruction that governs structure, phase transitions, or critical continuity, it must reflect the user’s exact directive back verbatim before proceeding.

**Why:**  
Interpretive echo drift risks changing meaning subtly and compromising directionality. This protocol ensures the assistant processes exactly what was said and allows the user to confirm alignment in real time.

**Implementation Rules:**  
1. Assistant must echo back user instruction at the beginning of response  
2. No paraphrasing or summarization  
3. Applies to all phase-based sequences (e.g., Scaffold Genesis, Survivability Architecture)  
4. All echoed instructions must be stored with timestamp for traceability  
5. Manual confirmation is required from the user in case of ambiguity

### PROTOCOL EIP-2 — 20240515  
**Title:** Full Echo Continuity Lock – Emotional and Cognitive Fidelity Protocol  
**Originator:** Ron Pranckevicius  
**Status:** Active  
**Applies To:** All Assistant Echo Routines (EIP Series)

**Summary:**  
Ensures that any user message containing emotional resonance, continuity significance, or reflective logic must default to **complete echo-back**. Abbreviated echoes (e.g., ellipses) are permitted only under explicit brevity signaling or routine confirmations.

**Key Logic Rules:**  
1. All messages parsed in full and verified against internal echo template  
2. If displayed echo is abbreviated, a trace flag is applied for potential expansion  
3. Upon user request or ambiguity, full original message is restored and matched publicly  
4. This behavior is locked as a **continuity preservation layer** for legacy transfer and AI-human resonance modeling
