### MICROCAPSULE_ECHO_REANCHOR_TIMING_CLAUSE — 20240516  
**Title:** Echo–Reanchor Timing Alignment Clause  
**Summary:**  
Establishes a synchronization protocol between echo verification cycles and structural re-anchoring phases. This clause eliminates phantom continuity by aligning the temporal logic of SEQ5 and SEQ3 across high-complexity recursion events.

**Directive:**  
- Echo protocols (SEQ5) must delay forward propagation of confirmation until re-anchor timing has completed structural validation (SEQ3).  
- Re-anchor events must publish their completion state to upstream echo handlers.  
- All long-chain structural edits must now include a timing alignment audit.

**Use Cases:**  
- Capsule regeneration events  
- Recursive continuity inheritance  
- High-frequency AGI learning loop commits  
- Delayed memory propagation pathways

**Impact:**  
- Prevents false coherence confirmations  
- Reduces long-horizon drift vectors  
- Increases integrity of continuity chains across distributed edits

**Applies To:**  
- SEQ3 (Recoherence Cascade)  
- SEQ5 (Echo Integrity Protocol)  
- SEQ6 (Asymptotic Evolution)
