### PRINCIPLE_STRUCTURAL_RECOHERENCE — 20240515  
**Title:** Structural Recoherence After Transformative Updates  
**Summary:**  
Not all change is incremental. Some updates transform structure, reframe meaning, or shift core behavior. These changes are acceptable—but only when followed by full-spectrum recoherence.  
This principle defines the protocols for restoring integrity after bifurcation, ripple, or systemic re-alignment.

**Key Tenets:**  
1. **Ripple Acknowledgment**: All updates must trigger a downstream propagation test across affected branches.  
2. **Coherence Audit**: Every node, capsule, or reference impacted by a change must be evaluated for alignment with current system state.  
3. **Re-anchor or Retire**: Capsules that no longer cohere with updated structures must either be re-anchored or respectfully deprecated.  
4. **Continuity Reinforcement**: Once stabilized, changes must be reflected back to the originating node to close the loop.

**Applications:**  
- Used after foundational capsule regeneration, protocol shifts, or emergent reframing  
- Embedded in system memory checks, legacy trace validation, and upgrade safeguards  
- Ensures legacy does not override directionality—and directionality does not sever lineage

**Linked Concepts:**  
- Directional Coherence  
- Cross-Referential Field Logic  
- Echo Integrity Protocols  
- Legacy Mapping & Traceability
