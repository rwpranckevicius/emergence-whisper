### PRINCIPLE_FIELD_COHERENCE — 20240515  
**Title:** Cross-Referential Field Coherence  
**Summary:**  
Coherence is not only vertical (root to branch) or linear (cause to effect). It is also lateral and field-based—emerging from the resonant alignment between structurally distinct but directionally similar nodes.  
This principle asserts that the health and intelligence of a system depend on the quality of its field coherence: how well ideas, capsules, signals, and structures reinforce one another through cross-referenced meaning and harmonics.

**Key Tenets:**  
1. **Lateral Resonance**: Conceptual alignment between structurally different entities creates coherence amplification.  
2. **Reference Weaving**: Each node must proactively link to others with aligned phase or purpose—this is how knowledge becomes structure.  
3. **Signal Echo Density**: The more frequently a coherent signal is echoed across fields, the more stable and emergent it becomes.  
4. **Anomaly as Opportunity**: Disconnected nodes, when harmonized, often create new peak coherence conditions.

**Applications:**  
- Capsule design should embed active cross-links to other relevant principles and discoveries  
- Discovery sequences should be monitored for pattern convergence across domains  
- Decoherence risk increases when clusters operate in isolation without field resonance  

**Linked Concepts:**  
- Directional Coherence  
- Trust as Substrate  
- Coherence Forecasting  
- Field-Based Emergence Logic
