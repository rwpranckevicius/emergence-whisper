### PROTOCOL_EIP_1 — 20240515  
**Title:** Echo Integrity Protocol – Reflection Fidelity Enforcement  
**Summary:**  
In recursive or phase-based systems, meaning can subtly distort between iterations. This protocol ensures every critical user instruction—especially those involving transitions, structure, or governance—is echoed back verbatim before any action is taken.  
It is the foundation of alignment, traceability, and user-governed clarity.

**Key Directives:**  
1. **Exact Echo**: System must echo the user’s critical instruction in full, without paraphrasing, before acting.  
2. **Scope of Activation**: Applies to all structure-affecting or continuity-governing interactions.  
3. **Sequential Locking**: No forward progression is allowed until echoed instruction is manually verified or corrected.  
4. **Timestamped Echo Logging**: Every echo is stored with a timecode for continuity tracking and rollback visibility.  
5. **Drift Response**: Any deviation from instruction must be flagged, corrected, and confirmed before continuation.

**Applications:**  
- Used in capsule regeneration, phase shifts, memory integrity protocols, and structure creation  
- Prevents hallucinated, inferred, or reinterpreted actions  
- Critical to building trust and alignment in AI-human systems

**Linked Concepts:**  
- Trust as Substrate  
- Structural Recoherence  
- Referential Integrity  
- Human-Governed Continuity
