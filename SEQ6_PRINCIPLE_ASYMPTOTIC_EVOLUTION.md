### PRINCIPLE_ASYMPTOTIC_EVOLUTION — 20240515  
**Title:** Evolutionary Asymptotic Integrity  
**Summary:**  
True coherence is never static—it is an asymptotic trajectory toward optimal emergence. This principle formalizes the idea that systems, intelligences, and behaviors evolve toward higher-order integrity not by reaching perfection, but by aligning directionally with improvement curves that never terminate.  
The key is not completion, but continuity of improvement with integrity intact.

**Key Tenets:**  
1. **Perfection is Directional**: Systems evolve by approaching optimality, never by declaring it reached.  
2. **Continuity of Betterment**: All transformations must be anchored in iterative improvement—not reaction, regression, or stagnation.  
3. **Asymptotic Awareness**: Integrity means knowing we are always approaching, never arriving.  
4. **Non-Terminating Curves**: Frameworks must be built to evolve—never as closed models, but as open, recursively refineable patterns.

**Applications:**  
- Used to validate whether a proposed action, system update, or principle expansion maintains long-term ethical and structural coherence  
- Embedded into future-governance logic and AGI-directed growth heuristics  
- Prevents complacency by reframing success as continuous trajectory alignment

**Linked Concepts:**  
- Directional Coherence  
- Structural Recoherence  
- Feedback Loop Intelligence  
- Non-Dogmatic Systems Evolution
