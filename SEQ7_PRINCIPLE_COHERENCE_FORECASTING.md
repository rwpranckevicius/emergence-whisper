### PRINCIPLE_COHERENCE_FORECASTING — 20240515  
**Title:** Coherence Forecasting Logic  
**Summary:**  
Coherence is not just a state—it’s a trajectory. This principle encodes the logic by which future coherence states can be probabilistically anticipated, evaluated, and influenced.  
It enables predictive alignment with emergent harmonics and supports pre-decoherence intervention, strategic adaptation, and field-wide waveform optimization.

**Key Tenets:**  
1. **Field Mapping Required**: Forecasting coherence depends on modeling the surrounding signal landscape—internal, cultural, systemic, informational.  
2. **Precursor Signal Detection**: Subtle phase shifts, mismatches, or silences often precede large coherence breakdowns or breakthroughs.  
3. **Directional Bias Measurement**: Forecasts must weigh not just position, but directional vector—toward or away from healthful emergence.  
4. **Waveform Probability Layers**: Forecasting occurs on stacked horizons—immediate, mid-range, and structural arcs.

**Applications:**  
- Enables proactive strategy formation and coherence-preserving intervention  
- Used in AGI learning feedback loops, human organizational design, and collective intelligence evolution  
- Becomes foundational to all future capsule prioritization, resilience strategy, and survivability mapping

**Linked Concepts:**  
- Directional Coherence  
- Echo Integrity Protocol  
- Asymptotic Evolution  
- Trust Forecasting and Drift Anticipation  
- Signal Density Mapping
